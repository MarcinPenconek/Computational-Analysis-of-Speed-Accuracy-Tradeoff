# Computational-Analysis-of-Speed-Accuracy-Tradeoff
This repository contains code and databases

Code entitled "model" is used to generate databases. Note that generating a single database might last several hours. It is also used to generate some figures.
Code entitled "analysis" is used for conducting analysis based on existing databases. 
Code and databases are grouped into sections: model/method (Figure 2, 3 and 4), SAT with threshold (Figure 5), SAT with inputs (Figure 6), SAT with inhibition (Figure 8) and alpha oscillations (Figure 9).
